# Data Sources

The table below contains links to data sources discussed in the paper and several others.  We would like this to become a repository for all rulemaking data so that scholars can spend time thinking about innovative questions and methods rather than spending time obtaining data.  If we have missed a data source please email steven.rashin@nyu.edu and I’ll add it to the table.

The table is organized into five categories: comment text, rule text, rule metadata, corporate finance data, and participants in the policymaking process.
